    <h2>
        <span class="underline">About Me:</span> My name is Brooke Raia, and I am a fourth year Communication Studies major here at the University of Georgia. Throughout my time here, I have learned who I was, who I have become, and who I want to be in this world. None of this growth, though, would have been possible without the help of UGA. As a freshman, I lived in Creswell Hall, and although I contracted the “Creswell cough” 4 times within my first semester on my own, I made some of my best friends within those white brick walls. I will always remember the night I was up coughing in the bathroom until 4 in the morning when a random girl living a few rooms down heard my misery, brought me cough drops and warm tea, and sat on the other side of the door talking to me until I was able to catch my breath again. That random hall-mate is now my future maid of honor and the reason I have learned the valuable lesson of friendship. I learned how important it is to go out of your way to help a stranger; after all, she might turn out to be your best friend. I also learned that living in a room the size of a shoebox may not be the most ideal living situation.
In high school, I played club volleyball. I had played since I was a kid, and I started to really miss it, so I joined an intramural team with a couple of girls that I met in my P.E. class. We made it our priority to become the champions of the end-of-season tournament, and we knew that was going to take some time and dedication. After school three times a week, the team would get together at Ramsey and practice until we could not practice anymore. Many times, there would be no open courts or gym space for us to practice in, so we would find ourselves passing back and forth in a hallway, in the ally behind the building, or in the spare racquetball rooms using a folded up ping pong table as the net. No matter what, though, our eyes were locked on that championship trophy, and we were going to do whatever it took to get it. One third of our team quit before we ever even played our first game, and our team lost every match we played. We did not even make it to the first bracket of the tournament; however, this experience is one that I would never trade in because it taught me the value of working hard simply because you are doing something that you love— even if the benefits are not always there for you to reap. 
Like many other liberal arts majors, I majored in Communication Studies because I did not know what I wanted to do. At 18, I was extremely prideful and far too stubborn to get a business degree simply because my father told me that I had to in order to be successful. Somewhere along the process of finding myself and drowning in the nerves of needing to pick a major that first semester of freshman year, I landed in a Communication Studies major because, well, I had nothing better to pick. A couple of speeches and many class discussions later, I found that one of my true passions in life is working with people. Whether I am talking to them, listening to them, or trying to understand them, I knew I wanted to pursue a career that followed my new profound interest in communicating to the public. Now with graduation approaching so quickly, my nerves have began to sink in, again. There is just something about leaving Dawg Nation surrounded by 38,000 of my favorite people experiencing something new every single day for a mundane nine-to-five that does not sound very appealing to me. Go figure! However, I look back on all of the memories and the wealth of knowledge that this place has given me, and I am confident moving forward with my career. Though I may not know where this life may take me or who I may meet, I know who I will always be— a dawg!
